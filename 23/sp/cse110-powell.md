  <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Inarguably software has become an integral part of modern life. Unfortunately, the predictable and efficient construction of software is far from settled practice. Formally Software Engineering (SE) aims to provide a framework to develop software products and systems using well-defined scientifically backed procedures that produce reliable and efficient enough software appropriate for a particular situation. Observationally, Software Engineering is not achieving its goals. Despite this gap, plenty of software is still successfully produced.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A potential factor in SE's shortcomings could be that formal training in the topic is highly varied and challenging due to logistics and environmental differences from industry coupled with the fact that people simply don't all share an agreed-upon view of what it is.&nbsp; Even if academic institutes rigorously define things, the majority of the industry may simply not acknowledge these findings.&nbsp; The reverse also holds where the industry does things in ways that academic SE rejects out of hand.&nbsp; This gap is simply not reasonable; both sides must be acknowledged for learners to get value from learning the core of SE in an academic setting.<br></span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Learner's background knowledge variability, disinterest or indifference in developing communication skills, and too often avoidance or ignorance of externalities--which often are the animating force behind our practices-- further complicate learning the topic.&nbsp; &nbsp;In fact, historically, in this course and others around the country, the specific tools, development practices, and project topics distract learners from what is actually going on.&nbsp; The majority of attention is placed on the specifics of execution, often missing the important ideas concepts underpinning them.&nbsp; This focus is likely at an all-time extreme this quarter and potentially beyond as large language model systems (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Github Co-pilot disrupt the profession.&nbsp; Rather than shying away from this, we will embrace the challenge directly.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;"><br>To this aim, this course will help students build a foundation of thinking skills, theoretical knowledge, practical application, and exposure to practical industry-tested experience. Engaged students will find that this course can provide them with a solid foundation upon which they may continue their journey to become Software Engineers.&nbsp; That last point should be internalized. Taking a single course will not make you an expert in this topic. Significant practice and further study would be required to meet such a goal.&nbsp; This course is but the start of a career-long journey.</span><br></span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This class is a project-based course that is a student-applied effort to learn modern software engineering practices, including agile development patterns, continuous integration, quality-focused code development, "complete" software beyond code, appropriate tool use, and do so in the face of uncertainty, individual challenges, and group dynamics. The class attempts to provide actual experiential style teaching to bring software engineering theory into practical practice. It should result in shipping quality code with appropriate related artifacts by the conclusion of the quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The project portion of the course should allow you to demonstrate understanding and execution of the complete set of Agile procedures and hopefully produce a product that&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Has complete and helpful documentation</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Is thoroughly tested and reviewed</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Exhibits only explainable&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">code smells</span></em></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Has user-focused interfaces that others have vetted</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Uses a modern build pipeline for predictable production</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ultimately any truly successful project should be able to be consumed and maintained by any reasonably skilled developer after the conclusion of the course without requiring such a developer to have been on your team.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;" data-preserver-spaces="true">To reduce risk and increase the likelihood of a successful project outcome, </span><strong style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">you will purposefully be limited in scope and design choices</span></strong><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;" data-preserver-spaces="true">. You will not have a wide range of project choices or technology purposefully to give you the freedom to engineer your solutions without rationalizations that the tool was the culprit or key to failure or victory, respectively.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Rough Schedule</strong></span></p>
<p>Week 1 -&nbsp; Intros, Logistics, Class Goals, Foundational Material, Motivation, Individual Management, Disruptive Effects of LLMs</p>
<p>Week 2 - Group Dynamics, "Practicing",&nbsp; <strong>Team Formation (Initial Tech Skills, Initial Social Skills), Project Setup</strong></p>
<p>Week 3 - User-Centered Thinking &amp; Design - <strong>User Stories and Design</strong></p>
<p>Week 4 - Process Models - Theory and Practice - <strong>Planning, Requirements, and Diagramming</strong></p>
<p>Week 5 - Interfaces and Patterns - <strong>Wireframe and Design</strong></p>
<p>Week 6 - Writing Engineering Level Code&nbsp;</p>
<p>Week 7 - Building and Managing Projects</p>
<p>Week 8 - Testing&nbsp;</p>
<p>Week 9 - DevOps</p>
<p>Week 10 - The Secret Life of Software, Class Retro</p>
<p>Final - Project Presentation Party</p>
<p><br>We will be using core web technologies, we will use some standard tools Github, Github Actions, etc., and we will have a partially constrained project that will involve--eventually--generative AI technology.&nbsp; You also will not have an open opportunity to do any project you like nor use whatever tool you like.&nbsp; We will set a constraint on the topic, but there will be a significant opportunity for design and technology exploration with this.&nbsp; If you take an advanced SE course (CSE 112 or others), more flexibility can be found.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Instruction Policies</h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This course will be taught dominantly live during the times indicated in the UCSD Schedule of Classes.&nbsp; The nature of Software Engineering in a group requires presence.&nbsp; While we have been quite used to asynchronous learning, the course topic does not mesh well with this.&nbsp; As long as we are safely able to meet "IRL" we will do so.&nbsp; Students should also understand while some degree of flexibility is likely given if things become challenging, flexibility may not be reasonable if you are with a group of 8-10 others.&nbsp; Don't let your teammates down with a lack of availability!&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Conduct and Netiquette</span></h3>
<p><span>In general, we should try to act just like we would in real life (IRL) in that we treat each other with respect and as fellow computing professionals.&nbsp; Students will be judged the same way in these online venues as IRL, so the <a class="external" href="http://raise%20your%20hand%20with%20the%20participant%20feature%20and%20wait%20until%C2%A0/" target="_blank">UCSD Code of Conduct</a> applies at all times, both in our physical classroom, labs, or online such as meeting with TAs or Professors.<br><br>A few specific tips on netiquette with particular emphasis on our tools are provided here&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>Slack</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use a real picture of yourself and a real name for clarity</li>
<li>Set availability/status</li>
<li>Respect Do Not Disturb, but don't hesitate to DM fellow teaching staff otherwise&nbsp;</li>
<li>Use threads on questions</li>
<li>Use channels for topics&nbsp;</li>
<li>Make sure you are aware of pinning, threading, searching, and posting as opposed to just simple chat</li>
<li>Use Giphy and custom emojis, etc. but keep most of it in #random</li>
</ul>
<h4>Canvas</h4>
<ul>
<li>We will try to use Canvas for most things per UCSD policy</li>
<li>Please fill in your Canvas bio and provide appropriate information there for your classmates to know and to be recognized</li>
<li>Assume class content will be produced first in other areas (Slack, Keynote slides, Zoom if needed etc.) and will eventually make its way to Canvas, but Canvas may not be the most immediate source of truth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>If you find a mistake in Canvas content, please advise the teaching staff&nbsp;</li>
<li>Canvas discussions will not be used.&nbsp; All chat and support will happen in Slack (class slack) and Group slack</li>
<li>Assignments will be issued via Canvas but may just be links including references to Slack.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Zoom (if end up using this at all I have provided some basics)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Raise your hand with the participant feature and wait until called on</li>
<li>Stay on mute on entry and until you are asked to unmute or are involved in a question</li>
<li>Use headphones for audio if at all possible</li>
<li>Please use video if you are comfortable with your own focus and for better personalization (bandwidth permitting).&nbsp; I would imagine your jobs did require this.</li>
<li>If you use a video background, it should be tasteful and appropriate</li>
</ul>

However, just like the course content, your content is ultimately yours, so if you do not want something to be used, please let us know so it will be excluded from consideration.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>Diversity and Inclusion</h2>
<p>We are committed to fostering a learning environment for this course that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives, and experiences and respects your identities (including race, ethnicity, heritage, gender, sex, class, sexuality, religion, ability, age, educational background, etc.). Our goal is to create a diverse and inclusive learning environment where all students feel comfortable and can thrive.</p>
<p>Our instructional staff will make a concerted effort to be welcoming and inclusive to the wide diversity of students in this course. If there is a way we can make you feel more included, please let one of the course staff know, either in person, via email/discussion board, or even in a note under the door. Our learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing process, and we welcome your perspectives and input.</p>
<p>We also expect that you, as a student in this course, will honor and respect your classmates, abiding by the UCSD Principles of Community (<a class="external" href="https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html" target="_blank"><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink ui-icon-inline" title="Links to an external site."><span class="screenreader-only">Links to an external site.</span></span></a><a class="external" href="https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html" target="_blank"><span>https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html</span><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink ui-icon-inline" title="Links to an external site."><span class="screenreader-only">Links to an external site.</span></span></a>). Please understand that others’ backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences may be different than your own, and help us to build an environment where everyone is respected and feels comfortable.</p>
<p>If you experience any sort of harassment or discrimination, please contact the instructor as soon as possible. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, please contact the Office of Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination:<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="external" href="https://ophd.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank"><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink ui-icon-inline" title="Links to an external site."><span class="screenreader-only">Links to an external site.</span></span></a><a class="external" href="https://ophd.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank"><span>https://ophd.ucsd.edu/</span><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink ui-icon-inline" title="Links to an external site."><span class="screenreader-only">Links to an external site.</span></span></a>.</p>
<h2>Students with Disabilities</h2>
<p>We aim to create an environment in which all students can succeed in this course. If you have a disability, please contact the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD), located in University Center 202 behind Center Hall, to discuss appropriate accommodations right away. We will provide you with the accommodations you need, but you must first provide a current Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter issued by the OSD. You are required to present their AFA letters to Faculty (please make arrangements to contact me privately) as well as to the OSD Liaison. &nbsp;This coordination should be handled in advance of the course so we may provide accommodations promptly.</p>
<h3><br>COVID Related Concerns</h3>
<p>Considering the significant challenges our society faces with COVID, we must modify our expectations in all directions -- faculty to student, student to faculty, and student to student. If you are affected directly by COVID or related events, please do not hesitate to reach out and help us make modifications to fit your situation. &nbsp;Physical and mental health is a significant part of appropriate learning; without it, we cannot be expected to perform appropriately. &nbsp;The same will hold for professional software engineers. Simply put, take of yourself, be kind to others, communicate, and stay safe and well in these challenging times.&nbsp; Finally, we follow the university's guidance on masking as an official for our course.&nbsp; You are quite encouraged and welcome to mask as you like.&nbsp; TL;DR - if masking seems the right thing for then mask up!<br><br></p>
