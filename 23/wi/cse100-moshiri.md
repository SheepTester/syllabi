Generally, any given day of the course schedule (let's use November 25 as an example), you will be expected to complete the following tasks:</p><ul class="amber-el amber-list"><li class="amber-el amber-listItem"><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content">Complete the <b class="amber-el amber-bold">topic videos</b> and <b class="amber-el amber-bold">readings</b> <i class="amber-el amber-italic">before</i> November 25</p></li><li class="amber-el amber-listItem"><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content">Complete the <b class="amber-el amber-bold">Reading Quiz (RQ)</b> <i class="amber-el amber-italic">before</i> November 25</p></li><li class="amber-el amber-listItem"><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content">Attend the <b class="amber-el amber-bold">Problem Solving Session (PSS)</b> <i class="amber-el amber-italic">on</i> November 25</p></li><li class="amber-el amber-listItem"><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content">Attend the <b class="amber-el amber-bold">Discussion</b> <i class="amber-el amber-italic">after</i> November 25</p></li><li class="amber-el amber-listItem"><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content">Work on the current <b class="amber-el amber-bold">Programming Assignment (PA)</b> or <b class="amber-el amber-bold">Project</b> (and complete it before its deadline)</p></li></ul><h2 class="amber-el amber-heading amber-content"><i class="amber-el amber-italic">Before Class: Topic Videos and Readings</i></h2><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content">Content in the course will be delivered asynchronously in the form of short <b class="amber-el amber-bold">topic videos</b> (~5–10 minutes each). Each day of the course schedule will have a few assigned topic videos, and you are expected to watch the topic videos <i class="amber-el amber-italic">before</i> the class on the corresponding day.</p><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content">For students in China who may not have access to the Topic Videos via YouTube, you can download them from the following Baidu Pan folder:</p><ul class="amber-el amber-list"><li class="amber-el amber-listItem"><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content"><b class="amber-el amber-bold">URL:</b> <a href="https://pan.baidu.com/s/1qthvEzk_H2Ag3c6zzqVW5A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="amber-el amber-link amber-el ed-focus-outline">https://pan.baidu.com/s/1qthvEzk_H2Ag3c6zzqVW5A</a></p></li><li class="amber-el amber-listItem"><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content"><b class="amber-el amber-bold">Code:</b> <code class="amber-el amber-code">vgfx</code></p></li></ul><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content">In addition to the topic videos, we will assign <b class="amber-el amber-bold">readings</b> from this course's free online interactive textbook, <i class="amber-el amber-italic"><a href="https://stepik.org/course/579" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="amber-el amber-link amber-el ed-focus-outline">Data Structures</a></i>, to supplement your learning. This interactive textbook has embedded multiple choice, free response, and even coding challenges, so you may wish to refer to it for practice (though the challenges embedded throughout the textbook will not be factored into your course grade).</p><h2 class="amber-el amber-heading amber-content"><i class="amber-el amber-italic">Before Class: Reading Quizzes (RQs)</i></h2><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content">Prior to a given day of the course schedule, after you have finished the topic videos (and potentially the optional readings) assigned for that day, you will complete a short <b class="amber-el amber-bold">Reading Quiz (RQ)</b>, which will be due at <b class="amber-el amber-bold">8:00 AM on that day</b>. All RQs are automatically graded instantly upon submission and will provide you feedback, and you have unlimited attempts until the deadline. <b class="amber-el amber-bold">You <u class="amber-el amber-underline">are</u> allowed to collaborate with your peers on the RQs.</b></p><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content">RQ points cannot be made up, and <b class="amber-el amber-bold">late RQ submissions will <u class="amber-el amber-underline">not</u> be accepted</b> in this course.</p><h2 class="amber-el amber-heading amber-content"><i class="amber-el amber-italic">During Class: Problem Solving Sessions (PSSs)</i></h2><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content">Instead of holding traditional lecture-style sessions, we will be holding synchronous instructor-led <b class="amber-el amber-bold">Problem Solving Sessions (PSSs)</b>. We expect that all students have at least been exposed to the topics for a given PSS <i class="amber-el amber-italic">prior</i> to attending (via the corresponding topic videos, assigned readings, and RQ). Thus, rather than regurgitating the exact same information, these PSSs will focus on the following:</p><ul class="amber-el amber-list"><li class="amber-el amber-listItem"><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content"><b class="amber-el amber-bold">Asking Questions.</b> As you watch the topic videos or work on the RQs, you will likely be confused (which is a good thing!). During the PSSs, you will be able to ask any questions you may have about the topic, and we will work together to overcome the confusion.</p></li><li class="amber-el amber-listItem"><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content"><b class="amber-el amber-bold">Discussing Concepts.</b> The topic videos and readings are by no means comprehensive: they merely scratch the surface of a given concept. During the PSSs, we will explore the concepts more deeply as a group.</p></li><li class="amber-el amber-listItem"><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content"><b class="amber-el amber-bold">Solving Problems.</b> In this class, we will emphasize "learning-by-doing," and while the RQs will help you get a taste of the types of problems you may encounter, the PSSs will allow us to think about more challenging problems, with an emphasis on real-world scenarios.</p></li></ul><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content">PSS attendance will be <b class="amber-el amber-bold">completely optional</b>, and recordings of the PSSs will be made available for you to follow along (or re-watch) asynchronously. However, we strongly encourage as much participation as possible, and all students will be expected to either attend or watch the recording of <i class="amber-el amber-italic"><b class="amber-el amber-bold">every</b></i> PSS.</p><h2 class="amber-el amber-heading amber-content"><i class="amber-el amber-italic">After Class: Discussion</i></h2><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content">Each week, we will be holding synchronous TA-led <b class="amber-el amber-bold">Discussion</b> sections, which will focus on the following:</p><ul class="amber-el amber-list"><li class="amber-el amber-listItem"><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content"><b class="amber-el amber-bold">Starting the PAs/Projects.</b> We understand that one of the most daunting steps when coding is the very first step: How do I even start? During the Discussion sections, we will provide an overview of the current PA/Project and provide some tips regarding how to approach it.</p></li><li class="amber-el amber-listItem"><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content"><b class="amber-el amber-bold">Asking Questions.</b> You will likely encounter the majority of your "learning breakdowns" as you work on the PAs and Projects, which may occur after the corresponding PSS. During the Discussion sections, you are welcome (and encouraged!) to ask any questions you may have.</p></li><li class="amber-el amber-listItem"><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content"><b class="amber-el amber-bold">Solving Problems.</b> You will have already attempted some problems while attempting the RQs and working on the PSSs, but those problems may not have been closely tied to the PAs/Projects. During the Discussion sections, we will work on problems more strongly resembling what you may encounter on the PAs/Projects.</p></li></ul><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content">Discussion attendance will be <b class="amber-el amber-bold">completely optional</b>, and recordings of the Discussion sections will be made available for you to follow along (or re-watch) asynchronously. However, we strongly encourage as much participation as possible, and all students will be expected to either attend or watch the recording of <i class="amber-el amber-italic"><b class="amber-el amber-bold">every</b></i> PSS.</p><h2 class="amber-el amber-heading amber-content"><i class="amber-el amber-italic">Programming Assignments (PAs) and Projects</i></h2><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content">The <b class="amber-el amber-bold">Programming Assignments (PAs)</b> will be the core form of assessment in this course. Typically, we will release a PA each <b class="amber-el amber-bold">Wednesday</b>, which will be due at <b class="amber-el amber-bold">10:00 PM</b> the following <b class="amber-el amber-bold">Tuesday</b>.</p><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content">Each PA will focus on the content covered in the 3 lectures during the week the PA was released. For example, if a PA is released on the Wednesday of Week 5, it will focus on content covered during the Monday, Wednesday, and Friday lectures of Week 5. All PAs are automatically graded instantly upon submission and will provide you feedback, and you have unlimited attempts until the deadline.</p><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content">In addition to the PAs, which are generally split into smaller chunks, we will have two larger <b class="amber-el amber-bold">Projects</b> towards the end of the course. These will combine data structures knowledge you acquire from class and homework with the pragmatics of writing a significant application that demands high performance.</p><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content">For both, the grade you will receive is the grade of your highest-scoring on-time submission. PAs and Projects will only be graded based on correctness: we will not grade for programming style (e.g. comments, indentation, etc.). However, we strongly urge you to maintain good programming style as you work on the PAs and Projects, as clean code is easier to read, interpret, and ultimately debug. Also, <b class="amber-el amber-bold">tutors will skip your ticket in the labs if they are unable to read your code easily</b>.</p><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content">While we encourage discussing higher-level conceptual aspects of the PAs and Projects with your peers, <b class="amber-el amber-bold">all work must be yours alone</b>. Sharing code (or anything easily translated into code) is a violation of UCSD's Academic Honesty policy and is not allowed.</p><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content"><b class="amber-el amber-bold">Late PA and Project submissions will <u class="amber-el amber-underline">not</u> be accepted in this course.</b> Start early, start often.</p><h2 class="amber-el amber-heading amber-content"><i class="amber-el amber-italic">Exams</i></h2><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content">You will have two exams in this course: a Midterm and a Final. The exams will be administered asynchronously: you will have a larger window of time within which you can choose to start the exam at any time, and from the moment you start the exam, you will have a limited amount of time to complete the exam (Midterm: 50 minutes; Final: 180 minutes). The time will be shown via a countdown. <b class="amber-el amber-bold">The dates of both exams can be found in the Course Calendar.</b></p><h1 class="amber-el amber-heading amber-content"><b class="amber-el amber-bold">Academic Integrity</b></h1><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content">All students <b class="amber-el amber-bold">must</b> submit the Academic Integrity Form at the start of the course. <b class="amber-el amber-bold">You will not receive <u class="amber-el amber-underline">any</u> course credit until you submit the form.</b> By submitting the form, you are agreeing to its terms, so be sure to read it carefully. We encourage you to study together and discuss concepts from this class, and you may work on the RQs collaboratively, but all PAs and Projects must be written completely independently. No sharing code or anything that can be trivially converted to code! If you are found to have violated the course's Academic Integrity Policy, you will receive an <b class="amber-el amber-bold">automatic F in the course</b>, and you may face even stricter sanctions from the University. In short, <b class="amber-el amber-bold">do not cheat!</b></p><h1 class="amber-el amber-heading amber-content"><b class="amber-el amber-bold">Getting Help</b></h1><p class="amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content">We expect that <i class="amber-el amber-italic">all</i> students will need help at some point in this course. If you find yourself needing help, this is not cause for embarrassment: it is completely expected, and our goal is to ensure that you are able to receive the help you need.
