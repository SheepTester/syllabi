<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>CSE 153 and 253 (and 153R / 253R) are undergraduate and graduate courses devoted to the application of machine learning to understand and generate music. After taking this course, students will be able to understand and manipulate data (and data structures) for music representation; students will be able to build predictive models and pipelines for music information retrieval; and students will be able to algorithmically synthesize music, culminating in a project demonstrating their creative work.</p>

<p>No previous background in machine learning or music is required, but all participants should be comfortable with programming (all example code will be in Python), and with basic optimization and linear algebra.</p>

<!--<hr />

<p><b>This page is under construction!</b></p>

<p>Several people have asked me for a course syllabus. Since this course is running for the first time the details aren't finalized yet. In the meantime, here's what I put in the course approval form, which should give you a <b>rough sense</b> of what the syllabus will be like. Details will be finalized by week 1:</p>

<pre>Course content: The course consists of a high-level view of Machine
Learning as it applies to modeling music, both in terms of prediction and
generation. The course will be hands-on, focused on developing tangible
artifacts on real-world datasets.

Syllabus:

The course will consist of five modules:

Module 1 (~week 1): data structures for music and data ingestion
- Primer on musical and machine learning terminology;
- Symbolic representations of music (e.g. midi/piano roll) (~1 lecture)
- Continuous representations of music (waveforms and spectrograms) (~1 lecture)

Module 2 (~week 2-2.5): simple predictive pipelines for music
- Will mostly cover classification and "standard" Music Information Retrieval
  (MIR) tasks, e.g. tagging, genre classification, onset detection, chord
  labeling, etc.
- This module also serves as revision of ML fundamentals (linear modeling,
  markov chains, and very basic introduction to deep learning). ~3 lectures total.

Module 3 (~week 2.5-5): symbolic-domain music generation
- Historical (non-ML) approaches e.g. grammars, rule-based methods, stochastic
  composition;
- Next-token prediction (e.g. Markov chain) approaches;
- Deep learning (DL) based approaches (DNNs, Transformers, etc.);
- Other symbolic-domain tasks other than generation (e.g. sequence-to-sequence
  tasks like arrangement/transcription);
- One "fun" lecture of academic case studies (this could be a guest lecture,
  but is also just "flex time" in case lectures are running long prior to the
  midterm); e.g. Piano Genie, DDC, MMT

Midterm (week 6) (+ one lecture of prep / revision)

Module 4 (~week 7-8): continuous-domain music generation
- More historical (non-ML) background (e.g. analog synthesis);
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (e.g. wavegan, specgan); or maybe
  musicVAE
- Diffusion models;
- One more lecture of academic case studies (again, leaving flex time)

Module 5 (~week 9): other topics in Music Information Retrieval (MIR):
- Music recommender systems; lyric translation, playlist generation; etc. two
  lectures, probably including guest lectures by graduate students.
- (time permitting) AI ethics, licensing issues, etc.

Project showcase (week 10): (performances of generated music or demos by
students for their final projects)

Assessment

Homework: The course will have 5 homework assignments (or “problem sets”)
corresponding to each of the 5 modules above. These will be due biweekly, with
the lowest grade dropped (allowing students to miss one module). Each homework
will be worth 10% of the final grade, for a total of 40% (after dropping the
lowest grade).

First assignment: A first assignment will take the form of a “kaggle-like”
competition on a simple-ish MIR task (e.g. genre classification). This
assignment will be due around week 7; this assignment format has been highly
successful in our other online classes (CSE158R/258R). This will be worth
approximately 20% of the final grade. Note that only a token proportion of the
grades (e.g. 2 marks) will be based on relative performance, with the majority
of assignment grades based on predefined performance criteria, so as not to
overemphasize the competitive aspect.

Midterm (may or may not run in first year): The midterm will take place in
week 7 and will have a 24-hour (take home) format. This format has proved the
most effective in our other online offerings, maximizing flexibility and
accessibility for remote students. This will be worth approximately 20% of the
final grade.

Final project: The final project will task students with applying what they
have learned creatively to demonstrate their music synthesis projects. This
will take the form of a short (possibly pre-recorded) presentation, accompanied
by an (algorithmically generated) musical piece. Projects will be showcased in
week 10. This will be worth approximately 20% of the final grade.
