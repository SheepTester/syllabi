<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This course will investigate instances when governments made major changes in the physical organization of large cities.&nbsp; We will study Rome in the fourth, twelfth, fifteen-sixteenth centuries, and twentieth century (it is a city with rich history), Paris in the nineteenth century, and New York in the twentieth century.&nbsp; In each case, we will look at how the cities were reorganized or changed, why the governments carried out the changes, and what difference the changes made in the way the cities functioned and represented both their political communities and their cultures.&nbsp; We will look carefully at the topography of these cities, at their geographical place in their countries or empires, at their political roles before and after the transformations, and at their social and economic characteristics.&nbsp; We will also look for the origins of urban planning, which is a major concern today but was not always of interest to those who sought to reorder cities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The chosen cities and eras give us a large number of issues and ideas to explore.&nbsp; When Constantine became a Christian in 312 C.E., just when he was conquering the city of the Rome and establishing himself as emperor, the city was both the capital of the Roman Empire and the center of its pagan cults.&nbsp; During the next century, the emperors transformed the city into a Christian city.&nbsp; It was a slow, even a cautious, process.&nbsp; We will explore what they did and why.</p>
<p>Then, in the late eleventh and twelfth centuries, the popes, the new rulers of Rome, acted to solidify and consolidate their rule.&nbsp; They did not alter roads or access to the city, but they planted their power in churches in the various neighborhoods.&nbsp; In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the papal rulers of Rome made changes to accommodate the hordes of pilgrims the popes had succeeded in luring to the city.&nbsp; Finally, when Mussolini came to power at the head of a fascist government in 1922, he set out to reshape the city to his ideology.&nbsp; The Rome we visit today is largely the product of his interventions.</p>
<p>From the twelfth century on, Paris was the governmental center of the French kingdom.&nbsp; It had long been the largest city in the kingdom, but from that time it became the home of an increasingly centralized royal government.&nbsp; By the time of the revolution that swept the monarchy from power in 1789, the city had become a choked jumble of houses on crooked, narrow streets that often led nowhere.&nbsp; The large governmental buildings—palaces, courts, churches etc.—were buried in an urban morass.&nbsp; The great plaza in front of Notre Dame, the cathedral church, was occupied by a dense neighborhood of buildings.&nbsp; In the middle of the nineteenth century, an autocratic imperial government under Napoleon III determined that the city must be completely renovated.&nbsp; Napoleon sought to make the city beautiful, efficient, and governable, while enhancing the prominence of and connection between the major buildings.&nbsp; We will look at the city before and after the great renovation, at the man who carried it out—the civil servant Georges-Eugene Haussmann—and at the cultural ideals the political, social, and economic ideas, and the new ideas about how a city should be organized (urban planning) that guided Haussmann and his bureau.</p>
<p>The New York City of today—with five boroughs, a centralized government, and a sense of unity—came together at the end of the nineteenth century.&nbsp; In the early 1890s, there were three cities in the counties of Manhattan, Kings, and Queens, and a good deal of rural space, especially in Kings (Brooklyn), Queens, and The Bronx.&nbsp; Staten Island was an independent rural county with no city.&nbsp; These elements were consolidated into a five-borough city in 1898, a period of rapid population growth because of massive immigration from southern and eastern Europe.&nbsp; In the first half of the twentieth century, this new city was tied together politically but not physically.&nbsp; As in Paris 60 years earlier, this conglomeration was brought together by a civil servant, Robert Moses, who carried out a program of bridge building, highway construction, parks, and cultural projects that remade the city.&nbsp; Moses was influenced by Haussmann, and he worked in a period when urban planning was becoming a major field of study.&nbsp; We will look at what he did, at the ideas that influenced him, at its costs and benefits, and at what difference the changes made in the life, the self-image, the socio-economic character, and the cultural life of the city.</p>
<p><strong>Educational Goals</strong></p>
<p>This course aims to introduce you to the skills and demands of a university education—reading critically and the construction of arguments based on evidence to support theses (statements in the form of “X is true”).&nbsp; These are the skills you will use in CAT 2 and 3, the writing courses in the sequence, in nearly all the upper-division courses you will take, and in any career you end up in.&nbsp; CAT 1 is the introduction to your education.</p>
<p>CAT 1 will also introduce you to the demands you will face throughout college.&nbsp; Every academic discipline progresses by formulating theses—general propositions about a subject—and then building arguments based on evidence to support those theses.&nbsp; Evidence can be found through observation (as in Astronomy, Anthropology, and Art History), in documents and interviews (as in History, Literature, and Sociology), or by experimentation (as in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics).&nbsp; Arguments consist in the application of reason to evidence, citing and organizing the evidence to make a point.&nbsp; In CAT 1, we will introduce you to the ways of assessing and using evidence to construct a convincing or at least a persuasive argument in support of a thesis.</p>
<p><strong>Contacting Me and Office Hour</strong></p>
<p>You should contact me by email.&nbsp; I do not have a campus phone number.&nbsp; If necessary, we can arrange a private Zoom meeting.&nbsp; The Zoom number is <strong>944 474 1338</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Office hour</strong> will be Wednesday 1:00-2:00PM.&nbsp; I will hold office hour on Zoom.&nbsp; The Zoom room number is <strong>944 474 1338</strong>.&nbsp; If you want to see me but cannot make it to my office hour, I will be happy to make an appointment for a different time.</p>
<p><strong>Participation in Section (Engagement)</strong></p>
<p>Discussion sections can only work if all their members are present and participating.&nbsp; You will be graded on participation in section, and your section grade will count for 10% toward your final exam.</p>
<p>You are allowed 2 unexcused absences (i.e. 2 weeks in CAT 1). For every unexcused absence after 2, you will lose 1/3 a letter grade of your overall <strong>course</strong> grade.</p>
<p><strong>Attendance at Lecture</strong></p>
<p>I encourage, but do not require, you to attend lecture.&nbsp; The lectures will give the course its thematic coherence.&nbsp; They also provide you an opportunity to ask me questions and raise points you think I missed.&nbsp; The class is large, but I will try to engage you in discussion when I think it will help you understand the topic and the course.</p>
<p>There will be weekly Lecture Quizzes that will count towards your course grade.&nbsp; The lectures and readings will also be the basis for the essays that will make up the Final Portfolio.</p>
<p>The CAT program has decided that the lecture hall will be divided into areas for each TA’s sections.&nbsp; So, you will sit in the same part of the hall in each lecture students should sit in the area designated for their sections.&nbsp; TAs will note who is at each lecture, but, again, a failure to attend lecture will not affect your course grade.</p>
<p><strong>Mask Policy</strong></p>
<p>The university has required that students wear masks in class.&nbsp; Wearing a mask protects yourself and others to exposure to the Covid virus.&nbsp; Students who cannot wear masks because of a condition that makes it unhealthy for them must receive authorization from the Office of Students with Disabilities.&nbsp; We will ask such students to distance themselves from others as much as possible in the class.</p>
<p>I will ask students who refuse to wear a mask to leave the lecture hall.&nbsp; If they do not leave, we will report them the office of student conduct.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Course Reader</strong></p>
<p>I have prepared a reader for the course.&nbsp; It is available for purchase through the website below. It is published and distributed by Cognella, Inc. through the UCSD Bookstore using the RedShelf feature of Canvas.</p>
<p>In addition, you must purchase Gerald Graff and Cathy Birkenstein, <em>They Say. I Say</em> (Norton, 2017).&nbsp; This book is an introduction to academic writing.&nbsp; In the syllabus, I have designated this work as TSIS.&nbsp; It is available in the UCSD Bookstore.</p>
<p><strong>Access to the Reader</strong></p>
<p>This Fall 2021 session your CAT 1 course will take part in a digital course material program called Inclusive Access. This service enables the Bookstore to offer our students instant access to online course materials at the lowest price possible.<br><br>This arrangement means you have immediate access to your CAT 1 READER text for the first two weeks of class--for free. Login to your course on Canvas and select the RedShelf link (on the left side panel) to access your digital book.<br><br>After the first week of free access, your student account will be charged the inclusive access price of $142.44 for 180-day access.<br><br><strong>If, for some reason, you decide you do not want to purchase these materials from the Bookstore, you can opt-out of the Inclusive Access program by going to the RedShelf link and clicking “OPT-OUT.” If you opt-out by October 9, your student account will not be charged.</strong><br><br>If you have any questions concerning Inclusive Access, please contact the bookstore or email <a href="mailto:help@redshelf.com">help@redshelf.com</a>.</p>
<p>This course material includes information that we will reference and use in class regularly, so you should be sure to purchase your own copy. Please keep in mind that UCSD is strict about copyright law, and course material should never be copied or duplicated in any manner.</p>

<p><strong>Nature of the Reader</strong></p>
<p>The reader contains chapters from several books.&nbsp; The chapters I have chosen are from scholarly works.&nbsp; To make it easier for you to understand them, I have provided introductions to the readings for each city.&nbsp; I also illustrated the chapters from Pinkney’s book on Paris, because no one, including me, can understand his work without maps.&nbsp; You will find the maps at the end of each chapter.&nbsp; I am not allowed to alter the text by inserting the maps where I would have liked.&nbsp; You will find pointers to the appropriate map(s) on the pages of the text.</p>
<p><strong>Lectures and Assigned Readings</strong></p>
<p>I have planned the lectures in a general way.&nbsp; That is, I know what topics I want cover in each lecture.&nbsp; But, what I have not planned precisely is what exactly I will do in each lecture.&nbsp; The varied pace and coverage of lectures is a common feature of university courses.&nbsp; In my experience of over 50 years, I’ve learned that the how much you cover in a lecture depends on many factors—what occurs to me that I did not think of as I prepared, responses to questions that students ask, following a train of thought into what turns out to a hole (interesting but really beside the point).&nbsp; So, reading assignments will be made by week, rather than day.&nbsp; You should try to get through the assigned readings as early in each week as you can.&nbsp; If you do that, you’ll be in a position to trip me up with questions and comments.&nbsp; I love being tripped by students.</p>
<p><strong>Assignments</strong></p>
<p>The assignments for the course will consist in three minor projects and one major project.&nbsp; <strong>Each assignment is specified on the Canvas page, Assignments.</strong></p>
<p><strong>All assignments will be submitted electronically to Canvas.</strong></p>
<p><strong>All the assignments, except the draft of the major project, will be uploaded from Canvas to Turnitin.com.&nbsp; This service will check your work against hundreds of thousands of papers handed in around the world.&nbsp; Turnitin identifies plagiarism (see below).</strong></p>
<p>For the major project you will produce a written response of 750 words (three standard pages, double-spaced, 12-point type).&nbsp; The major project will be done in two stages—a draft submission and then a final version due two weeks later.&nbsp; The draft will not be graded but you must submit it.</p>
<p>For the three minor projects, you will submit a response of 250 words (one page).&nbsp; These projects will be done in one stage.&nbsp; That is, you will not submit a draft and then a final version; you will only submit a final version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All projects must be submitted by 11:59PM on the day they are due.&nbsp; The Course Calendar specifies when the projects are due.</p>
<p><strong>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</strong></p>
<p>Students requesting accommodations because of a disability should provide a current Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter issued by the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD) which is located in University Center 202 behind Center Hall. Students are then required to present their AFA letters <strong>in advance</strong> to the faculty member teaching the course (please make arrangements to contact your professor privately) and to the OSD Liaison in the department, so that accommodations may be arranged. No retroactive accommodations will be provided.&nbsp; The CAT OSD liaison is Lynette Brossard: <a href="mailto:lbrossard@ucsd.edu">lbrossard@ucsd.edu</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Grading</strong></p>
<p>You will be graded on each project and on participation in section.&nbsp; You must submit projects by 11:59PM on their due date.&nbsp; Late submissions will be penalized 1/3 of letter grade per day late, so a <strong>b</strong> becomes a <strong>b-</strong> etc.&nbsp; If you submit the project more than one week late, it will receive an F.</p>
<p>The course grade will be calculated in the following way:</p>
<p><u>1 Major Assignment - 40%</u></p>
<ol>
<li>Evaluation Essay or Definitional Essay (includes submission of draft, participation in peer review, and submission of final draft)</li>
</ol>
<p><u>3 Minor Assignments - 30%</u>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Short Synthesis papers</li>
</ol>
<p><u>8 Lecture Quizzes – 10%</u></p>
<ol>
<li>Posted on Canvas, Quizzes, every Saturday, starting October 2 (Thanksgiving weekend and Week 10 excluded)</li>
<li>Due by 11:59PM on Sunday</li>
<li>You cannot complete a quiz late. The system will close at 11:59PM, Sunday.</li>
<li>Each quiz will contain 5 multiple choice questions. Grade will be recorded as follows: 5/5 = 95% (A), 4/5 = 85% (B), 3/5 = 75% (C), below 3/5 = 50% (F).</li>
</ol>
<p><u>Engagement in Section - 10%</u></p>
<p><em>(includes the Library tutorial)</em></p>
<p>See above for grading policy.</p>
<p><u>Final Portfolio – 10%</u></p>
<p>Responses to questions about the lectures and readings, due at the end of the final exam period (set by the university) in finals week</p>
<p><strong>Academic Integrity</strong></p>
<p>UCSD has a campus Policy on Integrity of Scholarship, published annually in the General Catalog, and online<a href="https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span> https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/</span><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink ui-icon-inline" title="Links to an external site."><span class="screenreader-only">Links to an external site.</span></span></a>. All students must read and be familiar with this Policy. All suspected violations of academic integrity will be reported to UCSD’s Academic Integrity Coordinator. Students found to have violated UCSD’s standards for academic integrity will be penalized according to the severity of the act.&nbsp; Academic sanctions may include failure of the assignment or failure of the course. University penalties include suspension or dismissal.</p>

<p><strong>Syllabus</strong></p>
<p>As noted above, the syllabus is organized by weeks, rather than by lectures.&nbsp; It is not possible to assign specific readings to each lecture.&nbsp; You should read the materials for each week as early in the period as possible, so that you can respond to the lectures and engage with your peers and TA in section.</p>
<p>The readings are divided into two parts—those that will be discussed in and are the basis of the lectures and those that will be used in sections.&nbsp; All assignments in TSIS are to be read for sections.&nbsp; In addition, two essays read in Week 1 will be discussed only in sections—the essays by bell hooks and Robin Kimmerer.</p>
