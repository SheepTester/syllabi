<ul>
<li>If for legitimate reasons a student is absent for the final exam, that student will be administered a MATH 18 make-up exam of equivalent difficulty. Every MATH 18 make-up exam will be different from the MATH 18 final exam administered at 7pm (PST) on 12/04/21.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>A student will receive the full %10 for the the discussion section participation grade provided they participate in at least <strong>8</strong> of their <strong>10</strong> enrolled discussions. Students must attend the discussion section in which they are enrolled to be eligible for the participation grade. If a student cannot attend the discussion in which they are enrolled, that student needs to re-enroll in a discussion they can attend to receive this %10. Students should feel comfortable they will receive the participation grade for a given discussion so long as they attend the discussion and follow the TA and SI leaders instructions. The math department runs a v<span>irtual advising center (vac.ucsd.edu), which is available to student should they wish to enrol in a different discussion. This should be particularly helpful to students wishing to enrol in another discussion if they are concerned about being placed on a waitlist.</span></li>
<li>The final exam is worth either %40 or %50 depending on the students grade for discussion section participation. If a students grade is higher when calculated with the final weighted at %50 and discussion section weighted at %0, then this higher grade will be the students final grade. If a students grade is higher when calculated with the final weighted at %40 and discussion section weighted at %10, then this higher grade will be the students final grade.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Homework&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>There will be weekly homework sets available via the MyMathLab tab in Canvas. The first homework is due on Monday October 4th at 11:59pm. The homework will be due on a weekly basis (Monday 11:59pm) after that, with the exception of Homework 5 (due on Tuesday 11/02/21 at 11:59pm) and Homework 10 (due on Friday 12/03/21 at 11:59pm).&nbsp; &nbsp;Homeworks can be turned in up to 48 hours late with a 50% penalty on the problems which were solved after the original deadline.</p>
<p>To access the homework, students need to purchase an access code for MyMathLab (see textbook subsection below). The students must register for the course via the MyLab and Mastering tab on Canvas.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You are allowed to use course notes and your textbook for your homework. You are also allowed to collaborate with fellow students. Every student must turn in their own assignment. Directly copying other students is not permitted. Using "homework help" resources like Chegg is not permitted.</span></p>
