<p>Topics covered include:</p>
<p>--Entity/Relationship Data Modeling</p>
<p>--Schema Design</p>
<p>--SQL Data Definition Language</p>
<p>--SQL Data Manipulation Language</p>
<p>--Indexing</p>
<p>--Materialized Views</p>
<p>--Triggers</p>
<p>--Embedding interaction with the SQL server into a client program developed in a general-purpose</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;programming language.</p>
<p>--Creating a Web application that is powered by an underlying database.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The course grade is based entirely on the project.</p>
