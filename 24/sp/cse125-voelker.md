<h2>Course Overview</h2>

<p> The goal of this course is to experience the design and
implementation of a large, complex software system.  In taking this
course, you will:

</p><ol>

<li> Have a software development experience that is closer to what you
will find in industry than with more traditional course projects.

</li><li> Work in large teams (six) and on a project too large to be
completed by the heroics of one individual.

</li><li> Build software using real-world tools instead of doing everything
from scratch.

</li><li> Build software with the stringent demands of a high-performance,
real-time, distributed application.

</li><li> Have some fun (really).

</li><li> Work on a project that you can showcase.

</li></ol>

<p> Over 10 weeks, you will decide what you want your project to be,
specify its requirements, create a design and implementation schedule,
and then implement it.  Because students find the application so
compelling, your project will be a distributed, real-time, 3D,
multiplayer game.  However, the overall goal of this course is not
necessarily to learn how to write games (notice that it was not listed
on the course goals?) — having the project be a game just makes
the development experience challenging, exciting, and fun.

</p><p> By default, we will work on Windows using OpenGL or DirectX.
However, this does not mean that you need prior experience with either
toolkit.  Remember that your project is a group effort, and only one
part of the project deals with graphics.  Groups in the past have also
used entirely open-source cross-platform libraries as well.  But, we
will not be using any game development kits — you will be
implementing your own game engine.

</p><p> The project requires both serious commitment and ability.  In
terms of time commitment, it will be on the order of the compilers
course or my CSE 120 operating systems course (using Nachos).  In
terms of ability, you will need to have excellent programming skills,
significant personal initiative, a well-developed capacity for
problem-solving, and a strong commitment to completing the group
project.  As an example, you will encounter problems that I will not
know the answer to (e.g., detailed problems with OpenGL).  Our TA
will be a veteran and a tremendous resource for tracking down
problems.  But you will also have to troubleshoot the problems
yourself or search online (Web pages, newsgroups, other graphics code,
etc.).

</p><p> This course is for more than just CSE majors.  It is intended to
combine the talents of students with strong programming backgrounds
(CSE, ECE, Math/CS) with students with strong creative talents in
digital arts and visualization (ICAM and CogSci).  If you have any
questions about whether the course is for you, send me email.  Since
the success of the project fundamentally depends upon your ability to
significantly contribute to a group effort, though, this course <i>should
not</i> be taken casually.  As a result, I am only allowing students to
enroll by instructor permission only.  See the <a href="#apply">application procedure</a> below for more information.

<!--

<p> The course is based upon a course I TA-ed a couple of times when I
was a graduate student at UW:

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/481/">http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/481/</a>
</ul>

<p> Note that the current version of the course at UW is no longer
doing games as the project.

-->

</p><h2>Mechanics</h2>

<p> There will be a few lectures at the start of the course, and then
weekly group meetings thereafter.  Other than the project itself,
there are no homeworks or exams, but you will produce a design
specification, a development schedule, weekly status reports, and a
final project writeup.  Grading will be based on a combination of
group and individual performance, including your ability to
contribute, collaborate, and communicate successfully as part of a
large group.  We will be meeting and interacting closely and
frequently enough that I will be able to appraise individual effort.

</p><p> We will finalize the groups at the end of the first day of class.
We'll do it in two stages.  First, I will ask for two volunteers who
are willing to work on the graphics engine for each game.  Once we
have graphics volunteers for each group, then I will ask people to
choose which group they would like to be a part of.  After the
enrollment process, and before the quarter starts, I will also send
out a list of everyone taking the course.  At that point, if you know
of people you would like to be in your group just let me know via
email (and cc: everyone in the group).

<a name="apply"></a>
</p><h2>Application Procedure</h2>

<p> Enrollment is by instructor permission only so that I can ensure
that students have sufficient background for the course.  To
make this kind of class manageable, enrollment is limited to
about 30 students.  Enrollment is on an individual basis.
You <b>do not</b> need to form a group, or be part of a proposed
group, before applying and taking CSE 125.  Similarly, even if you do
happen to have a group in mind when applying, it is possible for some
people in a proposed group to be admitted and others not (e.g.,
because they are not in their final year, and I gave priority to other
students in their final year who applied).  See "Mechanics" above for
how we ultimately finalize groups for the course.

</p><p>
Most students successfully taking the class are in
their last year and have taken a significant number of core classes.
<!-- but this is not mandatory.  -->
  My goal is to ensure that you are not getting in over your head,
and that you have the requisite programming skills, personal
initiative, problem-solving ability, and commitment to a group project
for the course.  It does
<i>not</i> require an outstanding GPA; I fully realize that some
students are much better software problem solvers and developers than
test-takers.

</p><p> To apply to enroll in the course, you will submit the following
information:

</p><ul>

<li> Your full name and student ID.

</li><li> Your UCSD and permanent (non-UCSD) email addresses.

</li><li> Your tentative schedule for next quarter (assuming you were taking CSE 125).

</li><li> Brief descriptions of any substantial programming projects you
have worked on (from classes, on your own, work, etc.).

</li><li> Areas you are excited to work on (e.g., graphics, networking, systems, UI, 3D modeling and animation, etc.).

</li><li> The quarter you expect to complete your degree.

<!--
<li> If there are other students you would ideally like to work with
in a group, list their names.

application: <a href="https://forms.gle/bAfApPpYJ12aQxSj7">https://forms.gle/bAfApPpYJ12aQxSj7</a>

</p><p> For the Spring 2024 quarter, the deadline for submitting materials
  is <b>Friday, February 23, 2024</b>.
<!-- Fri seventh week -->

<!-- tmp  -->
I will notify everyone of enrollment decisions by <b>Monday, March
4, 2024</b>.
<!-- Mon ninth week -->

<!-- tmp -->
Go ahead and enroll in courses as usual, and you can drop one
afterwards if you wind up taking this course.  You do not need to be
on the waitlist for CSE 125, students admitted will be cleared
to enroll directly.

<i> The application form for <b>Spring 2024</b> will be available here by
  Monday, February 5, 2024. </i>

</p><p> <b>Note:</b> To set expectations appropriately, please keep in mind that there
  are typically many more students applying for the course than space
  (e.g., often there are more than 100 applications for ~30 slots).

</p><p> If you have any questions about the course, do not hesitate to
  send me email.
  <!-- or drop by my office hours.
Unless I am traveling, my office hours during winter quarter are Monday 3&ndash;4pm. -->

<!-- and Wed 4-5pm. -->

<!--
If you have any questions, do not hesitate to send me email.  (I am on
sabbatical out of the country during winter quarter, and do not
currently have office hours.  So we'll have to make do with email.)
